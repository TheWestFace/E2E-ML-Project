Deployment on Elastic Beanstalk Linux Machine (AWS) requires python.config setup in .ebextensions
In respect to deployment, the code is in the Github repository.
We create a continous delivery codepipline to automatically deploy code changes in Github to Elastic Beanstalk instance. 

Step 1: Create AWS Elastic Beanstalk Machine and environment\
Step 2: Create codepipeline to integrate Github repo and continue deployment to Elastic Beanstalk.
